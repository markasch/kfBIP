# Welcome to kfBIP

This book contains a presentation of Kalman filters, from basics to ensemble filters. A large number of examples are provided in the form of jupyter notebooks. Then the notion of Bayesian inverse problems (BIP) is introduced.  Finally, there is a detailed presentation of the use of the ensemble Kalman filter as a basis for the solution of inverse problems. This is denoted EKI, or ensemble Kalman inversion, following the magnificent work of Andrew Stuart and his collaborators.

This book is based upon a number of sources. The original Bayesian formulation for inverse problems {cite}`Stuart2015` was the basis for the later ensemble Kalman inversion, presented in a series of papers {cite}`Stuart2013`, {cite}`Stuart2022`, {cite}`Huang2022`.

In {cite}`Asch2016` and {cite}`LSZ2015` the reader can find detailed presentations of Kalman filters approaches for data assimilation. In  {cite}`Asch2022` there are basic explanations of uncertainty quantification, inverse problems and their use for digital twins.
