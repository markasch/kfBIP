# Ensemble Kalman Inversion

This theoretical approach was formulated in {cite}`Stuart2013` and refined in the review {cite}`Stuart2022` (to appear in Acta Numerica 2025) and in the recent preprint {cite}`Huang2022`, where extensive numerical tests were performed.


## Formulation

Conceptually, the idea of EKI is very simple. Just apply the standard EnKF to an augmented system, for a given number of iterations, to invert for u.
